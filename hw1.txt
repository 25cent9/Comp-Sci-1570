  b.) If current student has their own ID then proceed to step 
  c.) If current student does not have their own ID then current student
  must talk to the next student

  e.) If one student finds their ID when comparing with the other student
  then both students swap IDs
  f.) Once student has their own ID, student leaves the party

2. Solution:
  a.) Gather number from the user
  b.) If any digit is A or B then switch them to 11 and 12, respectively 
  c.) Take each digit in the number and split them up based on their positon
  d.) For each postion, from 0-12, find the product of the current digit and
  12 to the current base
  e.) Once all of the products for each digit is found, add all of the
  numbers together to get the base 10 representation of the base 12 number
3. Solution:
  a.) Read in the first word and store it
  b.) Read in the second word and store it
  c.) Compare the first character of both words, if they're both the same
  then continue on to the next character
  d.) Repeat step c until a match is not found
  e.) If current characters don't match then find the numeric values of both
  characters and subtract them
  f.) Once the value is found, take the absolute value of that number and
  that will be the lexographic difference
